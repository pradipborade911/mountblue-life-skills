# Tiny Habits  

## Question 1: Most interesting story or idea as per video?  
The most interesting idea was the concept of starting habits with a super tiny action that takes less than 30 seconds, then celebrating each small success to build momentum and make the habit stick.

## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
To make new habits easier with B = MAP:

    B (Behavior): Specify the action you want to adopt.
    M (Motivation): Make sure it’s something that excites you.
    A (Ability): Keep it simple and doable.
    P (Prompt): Set a clear reminder or trigger to do it.

For example, if you want to start jogging:

    M: Think about how great you'll feel after exercising.
    A: Start with a 5-minute jog.
    P: Jog right after you wake up each morning.

## Question 3 : Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
It makes the experience positive and reinforces the behavior. It creates a sense of accomplishment and triggers a release of dopamine, which helps make the habit more automatic and enjoyable over time. The more you celebrate, the more likely you are to continue the habit and build it into a lasting routine.

## Question 4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea was the concept of using "temptation bundling"—pairing a habit you want to build with an activity you enjoy. For example, you might only listen to your favorite podcast while exercising. This makes the new habit more appealing and helps build a consistent routine.

## Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book suggests that changing your habits effectively involves focusing on who you want to become, not just on what you want to achieve. It emphasizes building habits that align with your desired identity.

## Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
Making a Habit Easier:

    Reduce Friction: Make the habit as easy as possible by cutting down any obstacles.
    The Two-Minute Rule: Start with a version of the habit that takes two minutes or less.
    Prime the Environment: Arrange your surroundings so that the habit is the easiest choice.

## Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
Making a Habit Harder:

    Increase Friction: Add steps or barriers that make it more challenging to engage in the habit.
    Design Your Environment: Modify your surroundings to make the habit less accessible or convenient.

## Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
One habit I want to do more is working out regularly. To make it easier:

    Obvious Cue: Keep my gym clothes and gear out and visible so I’m reminded to work out.
    Easy Response: Start with short, manageable workouts and gradually increase the time.
    Satisfying: Reward myself with a nice post-workout smoothie or some downtime after finishing.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
One habit I want to cut down on is scrolling through social media. To make it less appealing:

    Invisible Cue: Turn off non-essential notifications and move social media apps to the last page of my phone.
    Unattractive Process: Delete apps from my home screen and set specific times for checking them.
    Hard: Use app blockers to limit my time on social media.
    Unsatisfying: Replace social media time with more engaging activities like reading or exercising.
