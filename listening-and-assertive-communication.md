## 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

**Give Full Attention:** Make sure you’re fully present in the conversation. This means putting away distractions like your phone and focusing entirely on the speaker. Eye contact and nodding can show that you’re engaged.

**Show Engagement:** Use nonverbal signals to demonstrate that you’re listening. This can include nodding, maintaining eye contact, and using brief verbal affirmations like “I understand” or “That makes sense.”

**Avoid Interruptions:** Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts before you respond. Interrupting can disrupt the flow of the conversation and might prevent you from fully grasping their point.

**Reflect and Paraphrase:** Once the speaker is done, try summarizing what they’ve said in your own words. This helps ensure you’ve understood correctly and shows that you’re actively processing the information.

**Ask Open-Ended Questions:** To encourage a deeper discussion, ask questions that require more than a simple yes or no answer. This not only shows your interest but also helps clarify any points that might be unclear.

**Respond Thoughtfully:** Take a moment to consider your response before speaking. This ensures that your reply is well-considered and reflects your understanding of the speaker’s message.

## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)

Reflective listening is a technique that helps ensure understanding and resolve misunderstandings by focusing on how we reflect back what the other person is saying.

**Mirroring Feelings:** Reflect the emotions of the speaker by acknowledging how they might be feeling. For example, if someone is upset, you might say, "It sounds like you're really frustrated."

**Verifying the Message:** Make sure you understand what the speaker is communicating by repeating or paraphrasing their words. This can help confirm that you’ve got the right message. For instance, "So, you're saying that the deadline is moved up to next week?"

**Body Language and Tone:** Pay attention to nonverbal cues like body language and tone of voice. Reflecting these can show that you’re tuned in to their overall message, not just their words.

**Clarifying Misunderstandings:** If there’s any confusion, ask clarifying questions or restate what you heard to make sure everyone is on the same page.

**Encouraging Open Dialogue:** Use reflective listening to encourage more open and honest conversation. By showing that you’re really listening, you create a space where others feel comfortable sharing more.

**Responding Appropriately:** Your responses should be based on the reflections and understanding you’ve gathered. This helps build trust and ensures that your replies are relevant and supportive.

## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?
**Distractions:** External noise, interruptions, or multitasking can pull your attention away from the speaker. This makes it hard to fully engage and absorb what’s being said.

**Prejudgments:** Forming opinions or making assumptions about the speaker or the content before fully listening can cloud your understanding and bias your response.

**Emotional Barriers:** Personal emotions, such as frustration or anxiety, can interfere with your ability to listen effectively. When you're preoccupied with your own feelings, it’s difficult to focus on the speaker.

**Lack of Interest:** If the topic isn’t engaging or relevant to you, it can be hard to stay focused and attentive, leading to missed details or disengagement.

**Inadequate Understanding:** If you don’t fully grasp the subject matter or the vocabulary used, you might struggle to follow along and respond appropriately.

**Rushing to Respond:** Thinking about your reply while the other person is still talking can prevent you from truly listening and understanding their message.

## 4. What can you do to improve your listening?
**Minimize Distractions:** Create a conducive environment for listening by reducing noise and avoiding multitasking. Focus solely on the speaker.

**Practice Open-Mindedness:** Keep an open mind and avoid jumping to conclusions. Listen without letting your preconceived notions or biases affect your understanding.

**Manage Emotions:** Be aware of your emotional state and try to set aside personal feelings that might interfere with your listening. Take deep breaths or pause if needed.

**Stay Engaged:** Show interest in the conversation by asking questions, nodding, and providing feedback. This helps maintain focus and shows that you value the speaker’s message.

**Clarify and Summarize:** If something is unclear, ask for clarification or restate what you’ve heard to ensure accurate understanding. This helps in retaining and accurately processing information.

**Avoid Interrupting:** Let the speaker finish their thoughts before responding. This ensures you fully understand their message and can provide a more thoughtful reply.

## 5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?
Passive communication typically occurs in situations where:

**Avoiding Conflict:** You want to avoid disagreements or conflict, so you stay quiet and go along with others' wishes, even if it means sacrificing your own needs or desires.

**Low Confidence:** You might feel insecure or lack confidence in expressing your own opinions or asserting your needs.

**Power Imbalance:** You’re in a situation where you feel outmatched or intimidated, such as in hierarchical relationships or with authoritative figures.

**Harmonious Relationships:** You’re aiming to maintain harmony in relationships, choosing to go along with others to keep peace, even if it means not voicing your true feelings.

## 6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?
Aggressive communication may emerge when:

**Feeling Frustrated:** You’re upset or frustrated and express it through hostility or assertiveness, often disregarding others' feelings.

**Defending Yourself:** You feel attacked or criticized and respond with defensiveness or aggression to protect yourself.

**Wanting Control:** You’re trying to dominate a conversation or situation to assert control or impose your own views.
**High Stress:** Under significant stress or pressure, you might react aggressively, venting your frustration outwardly.

## 7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?
Passive-aggressive communication can surface when:

**Avoiding Direct Confrontation:** You’re unwilling to address issues directly, so you express your frustration through indirect means like sarcasm or silent treatment.

**Resentment:** You feel resentful or hurt but don’t want to address it openly, leading to indirect expressions of your feelings.

**Manipulating Outcomes:** You’re trying to influence others subtly or undermine them without being overtly confrontational.

**Powerlessness:** You feel powerless or unable to assert yourself directly, so you resort to indirect methods to express your discontent.

## 8. How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)
**Use “I” Statements:** Express your feelings and needs clearly using “I” statements, such as “I feel...” or “I need...”. This helps you communicate your perspective without sounding accusatory or confrontational.

**Be Clear and Direct:** Clearly articulate your thoughts, feelings, and needs without beating around the bush. Avoid vague language and be straightforward about what you want or need.

**Maintain Open Body Language:** Use confident body language, including maintaining eye contact, standing or sitting upright, and using open gestures. This helps convey that you’re confident and sincere.

**Practice Active Listening:** Show that you’re listening by nodding, reflecting on what the other person says, and responding appropriately. This demonstrates respect and helps in mutual understanding.

**Set Boundaries:** Learn to say no when necessary and set clear boundaries without feeling guilty. Respect your own limits and communicate them respectfully.

**Stay Calm and Composed:** Manage your emotions and avoid reacting impulsively. Stay calm and composed, even when discussing difficult topics, to maintain control and clarity in the conversation.
