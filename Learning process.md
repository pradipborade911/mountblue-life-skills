# Learning Process: A Guide to Effective Learning

### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line
It is a learning technique where we explain the concept in plain, simple language to review and improve our understanding.


### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
I really liked the idea of stepping away from a problem when you’re stuck, allowing your mind to switch to a diffused mode of thinking, where it can work on the problem in the background without focused attention.

I also liked the perspective that true mastery isn’t just about understanding concepts but involves repetitive practice in different situations to fully grasp and apply them.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- **Active mode:** This mode of thinking is when we concentrate on a specific problem or task to understand it precisely.
- **Diffused mode:** In diffuse thinking, you take your attention away from a specific problem and let your mind relax. This broader, more relaxed state allows your brain to explore different ideas and make connections you might miss when you're focused too closely on one thing.

### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- Deconstruct the skill
- Learn enough to self-correct
- Remove practice barriers
- Practice for at least 20 Hours

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- **Feynman Technique:** I will remember that to truly learn something, I need to explain it in simple terms.
- **Diffuse Mode of Thinking:** I will use relaxed, broader thinking to help get unstuck when facing problems.
- **Pomodoro Technique:** I will use this method to tackle procrastination and stay focused.
- **Mastery through Understanding and Practice:** I will work on mastering concepts by practicing and repeating them in different situations.
